<p>When you deal with an outsourcing company for building a product, you are expecting
quality service, a clear understanding of what&#8217;s happening, and regular status updates. Of course, these criteria are vital for you because you pay for the work. Make sure that your initial agreement includes metrics of how to track the workflow process and results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The issue of traditional project management approaches lays in spending too much time implementing a
hypothesis, which may not work for users. Also, the actual result may not meet expectations due to
miscommunication or incorrect interpretation of requirements by the team. In modern project management
concepts, we create the MVP (minimum viable product) with a minimum set of resources to check and verify the idea and business model, as well as to gain the first profit or investment.</p>

business-oriented professionals in the company.</p>

<p>So why is Agile so successful? Let&#8217;s look into three Agile values that won us over.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_value_1_risks_of_loss_are_low">Value #1: Risks of loss are low</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main question to ask as soon as an idea is born is: will people like, buy, and use what we&#8217;re creating? Usually, this question is answered when it&#8217;s too late.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on Agile approaches, we have to deliver the critical MVP as soon as possible. The MVP could be any
solution that solves the problem you detected. Even if, having developed the MVP, you understand that the product isn&#8217;t feasible, the losses - time and money - will be lower than if you had developed a huge product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why? The main advantage is to provide a functioning product that is usable at an early stage. How do we know it&#8217;s usable? We deliver earlier to get feedback. Once the MVP is delivered, we build more and more nice-to-have features, and the product grows.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bike with a motor that allows people to move quicker than using just a bicycle. With
this MVP, people&#8217;s needs are satisfied, the idea is verified, and the business becomes successful. Then, the product is further developed iteratively to its final view:</p>

<p>The product may be delivered not as expected due to lack of domain expertise within a team, or
misinterpretation of requirements, but not because the team lacks technical skills alone. That&#8217;s why the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Daily Meeting / Daily Standup is a face-to-face synchronization meeting between development team members to provide status and be sure that they can move on as a team. It takes only 15 minutes but helps to remove impediments, highlight the risks, and perform as a team, not as solo players.</p>

<p>Status update allows all team members (distributed and onsite), customer, and stakeholders to know the
current status of how close we are to achieving the goal.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Agile practices were invented by developers for developers based on the main recurring problems they faced in communication, knowledge sharing, and prioritization. For that reason, don&#8217;t be scared of managers who would like to follow Agile for your team - try to understand the value you can get.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The three main values we see in Agile are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Value #1:</strong> If we deliver a minimum viable product as soon as possible, we verify the need for
this product while the potential losses are low.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Value #2:</strong> The earlier and more often product team and customer learn, the lower the cost of a
mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Value #3:</strong> With transparent communication, we manage the current status of work and the
expectations of our customers and stakeholders, and vise versa.</p>

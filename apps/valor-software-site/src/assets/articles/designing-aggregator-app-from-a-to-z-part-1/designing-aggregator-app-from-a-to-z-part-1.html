<p>Almost every movie place in our city offers an app to search for movies and buy tickets. So, you need to use several apps in parallel, you lose time comparing movie sessions and prices to make
the right choice. My task was to fix this and make this movie escape easy and convenient. I thought of one and only app that would display all the movie places and movies available. It would also allow for picking the movie from all the possible options in the city and purchasing them online.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll share how to design an app and lead you through every stage from user research to mock-up. Learn how to gather the information you need and create a splashing design based on users' pains and preferences. And, good luck with your beginnings :)</p>

<p>Sophia never attended the movies since the pandemic, and she&#8217;s not really a huge fan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Spending time with her dear people, especially with the nephew who loves cartoons. Sophia prefers
impressive special effects on a big screen and watching films right after the release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How she picks movies and buys tickets</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She checks the trailer on the movies' website or just somewhere on the Internet, then - buys tickets from the official website. Sophia generally finds it convenient unless they have troubles with the website (when it doesn&#8217;t work for a few days). Then she books tickets through the phone and then purchases them at the movies. She doesn&#8217;t use apps because that&#8217;s her partner&#8217;s prerogative.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Suggestions on how to improve the service</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<li>
<p>Create one and only app that would give information about every single movie place in the city, also - allow booking and purchasing tickets.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Make fewer registration steps on the way to the purchase.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>She&#8217;s been to the movies a couple of times because of the pandemic. Before she used to go there monthly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s a nice way to have fun and relax with friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How she picks movies and buys tickets</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She usually checks the trailer, searches for ads about the film, and considers her friends' feedback. Before she used <a href="https://multiplex.ua/cinema/kharkiv/dafi" class="bare">Multiplex</a>to pick a movie and purchase tickets as she used to live right next to this
movie place. Now she lives downtown and prefers the Planeta Kino&amp;nbsp app. It provides a user-friendly
interface, a great variety of films, and an Apple pay payment method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She&#8217;s frustrated because it takes time and effort to switch seats when you book tickets online. After the choice is made, she has to wait for 15-20 minutes till her previous order gets canceled. And someone can book the seats she wants while she&#8217;s waiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Suggestions on how to improve the service</strong><br>
- Organise the catalogue of films the way we can see several options on one screen at once, this speeds up the search. Planeta Kino offers horizontal scrolling and shows just one film on a mobile screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Offer an easy way to change the booked seats for other ones before the purchase.</p>

<p>To feel the frustration users tend to feel while using apps, I communicated with them and tried myself in the
role of a user. I visited 2 movie places in my city, Planeta Kino and Multiplex. This way, I was able to

behavior, also the tech they&#8217;re using to provide a better service.</p>

<p>Alexander reached for his phone to find tickets online through the app. He checked the posters of
the movies playing that day, and the new Justice League caught his eye. He watched the trailer, checked the
movie story, and decided to go for it. He chose a movie place that was closest and a suitable session, picked
seats for two, and paid for the tickets. Then, he checked the tickets', added them to 'Wallet' for quick and
easy access, and closed the app. Finally, time to get ready for the show!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a while, Alexander and his friend met at the movies and joined the line to enter the movie hall. Alexander prepared the tickets for scanning in the "Wallet".

<p>It was a usual working day. Alexander was on a lunch break, discussing the upcoming Justice League, which had been added to the future release at the movies. Everyone was looking forward to seeing it. The only way to get tickets for the premiere was to pre-order them online. He picked up his phone, downloaded the application, opened it, skipped the registration, and in no time found the movie he was seeking. He selected the movie place, session, and seats.
Before he had a chance to pay for the tickets, the App asked for mandatory registration to complete the
purchase. He&#8217;s registered in one tap with his Apple account. After the registration, he paid for the tickets,
checked the ticket details, and closed the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In three weeks, on the movie premiere day, Alexander and his friend met at the movies and stood in line in front of the entrance to the movie hall. Alexander opened the application, went to the 'Tickets' section, and prepared the tickets for scanning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After check-in, they entered the movie hall, took their seats, and started watching the movie. Alexander
liked the movie very much. After watching, he received a notification from the App asking him to rate the
movie. He gave it 5 out of 5.</p>

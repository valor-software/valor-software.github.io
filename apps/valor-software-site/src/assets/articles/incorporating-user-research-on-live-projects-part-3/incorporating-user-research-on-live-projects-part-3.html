<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, so what about user research in times of a pandemic? Is it even possible? Thanks to technological progress,
people now are much better technically equipped, and video calls are not a surprise anymore. The key is
preparation and moderation skills while running an interview or a contextual inquiry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We did the following to conduct user research effectively:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Set up video calls. In our case, we had 2 calls in Google Hangouts and 1 in Zoom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chosen screen and audio recorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arranged meetings in advance, sent invitation letters with a short explanation of the purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asked participants to be ready to show some of their notes, the software they use in their workflow, to be
ready to share their screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepared a cheatsheet with topics to discuss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking ahead, I want to say that all 3 arrangements went well and productive. On average, inquiries lasted
1-2 hours. They were productive and gave lots of insights. The structure of each session was the
following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Introduction. Thanking for giving your time, and asking for consent to record audio and video. Telling
more details about the purpose of the study and its structure (1st one - interview, second -
observation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting with simple questions, such as: What is your role? What&#8217;s the first thing you do when you come to
the office? What are your daily activities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving to more complex topics: start talking about frustrations and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going deeper: discussing specific spheres of work, for example: how do you forecast any budget/workforce
losses? What helped you in preventing high turnover? What the lack of data interferes with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asking to show the process of gathering and analysing data about employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observing and making tips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeating.</p>

</ol>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_transcribing"><strong>Transcribing</strong></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step before we can go to the data analysis, is to transcribe
our inquiries. For me, honestly, it was the most boring part of the study, but still crucial
\uD83E\uDD37\uD83C\uDFFB\u200D. While making a study, we can&#8217;t manually record all the communication - it&#8217;s
better to take some notes and clarifications to deepen the conversation later. So after we are done with an
inquiry, we make a cup of coffee/tea, sit down, play the recording, and start typing. Absolute
concentration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On average, each interview was 5-8 pages long. We really got a lot of information -
especially in combination with video recordings of participants' workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But to find any patterns and tendencies, so that we can form design suggestions, we have to work out the data - in our case, qualitatively. How can we do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_qualitative_data_processing"><strong>Qualitative data: processing</strong></h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_affinity_diagramming"><strong>Affinity Diagramming</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Affinity Diagramming is a method we used while working with qualitative data. The essence of the method is
uniting observations, ideas, quotations - everything we have got during our studies into clusters on a basis
of similarity and affinity. So we basically make groups of information pieces that have something in common.
Then we label these clusters.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what was the process in our case?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After transcribing the interviews, I wrote
down all the key observations, thoughts, frustrations, and tricks on hundreds of post-it notes. To make the
process of sharing deliverables easier (in terms of total remote work with peers), I have chosen the Miro
tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each color defined a specific participant. I processed each interview separately, and as a result, had huge
masses of information gained from inquiries with respondents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a real mess, and the next step I should have done - is clustering all these pieces into groups so that we can analyze them, and find common patterns, problems, and needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result we had:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turned out, that <strong>the most crucial challenges</strong> our potential users faced in their everyday activities were the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Having data for different types of people analytics in different tools and spreadsheets causes a time
increase in processing, comparing, and finding correlations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too many spreadsheets and different tools make knowledge sharing and transferability between HR department
team members complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The complexity of storing information (too many steps because of many tools) causes incorrect data about
employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Budget losses caused by lack of the data, such as: absenteeism, burnout, correlating quantitative
performance, and engagement, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low level of turnover prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is hard to track effectiveness of recruitment, organisational, and educational programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What are the key needs</strong> discovered within the research?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be valuable among other departments with the help of data-driven approaches and metrics</p>

<li>
<p>Keep turnover and retention on a benchmark</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on a quick review of the clusters, I brainstormed ideas we
could bundle into the feature. Note - it is much better to try this activity with your team to collect diverse
approaches and solutions. Such workshops help teams be on the same page while working on the discovery and
ideation stage of the product/feature/enhancement development, and increase engagement.</p>

<p>The report with supplying materials, as competitors' analysis, initial hypothesis,
informational structure, and widget ideas was presented to the product owner and QA lead of the team and then
sent to other team members. The next step was wireframes creation. Mostly we focused on such features, as:</p>

<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, if you&#8217;re about to run a research, nothing can stop you.
And when the pandemic comes - comes help from the technologies. Video calls that you schedule in advance might
be even more efficient than live meetings since people do get ready for those and even come on time. Maybe
that&#8217;s because communication became even a more lively need these days :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your questions for the
interview are ready, prepare yourself for another role on top of an interviewer. You need to moderate the
conversation in order to pick up the most valuable grains for your research. This requires attention, so make
a cheatsheet with topics to discuss. When ready with this part, you need to transcribe the requirements you
gathered. You record, then you transcribe taking all the time you need because this takes time.When all the
key observations are at hand, you can ease the process of sharing deliverables by going with the Miro tool.
You realize the most crucial challenges of potential users and formulate the key needs. Now it&#8217;s just a
detailed report with Key Insights and Design Ideas left to complete the mission. Good job!</p>

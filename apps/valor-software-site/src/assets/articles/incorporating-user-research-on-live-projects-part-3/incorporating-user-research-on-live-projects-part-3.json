  "seoDescription": "If your questions for the interview are ready, prepare yourself for another role on top of an interviewer. You need to moderate the conversation in order to pick up the most valuable grains for your research. This requires attention, so make a cheatsheet with topics to discuss. When ready with this part, you need to transcribe the requirements you gathered. You record, then you transcribe taking all the time you need because this takes time."

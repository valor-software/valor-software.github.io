<p>Hey everyone, Medusas speaking!
Back in September, we <a href="https://valor-software.com/articles/medusa-the-only-commercial-available-saas-platform-for-federated-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> about our re-launch of the only commercially available tool for Module Federation - Medusa. The community expressed deep interest, mostly, in the form of feature requests, which is great! We&#8217;re excited to bring you updates on those requests towards Medusa. So, let’s see what we have to share after the last few months’ hot (burning) sprints. We’ve broken the “new arrivals” into two segments to help you digest them simpler. Here you go! See the updates for the two main categories:</p>

<h3 id="_module_federation_client">Module Federation Client</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_issue_regarding_remote_ids">The issue regarding Remote IDs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We previously encountered an issue, using remote IDs that included the @ syntax. This issue has now been resolved, and you can use remote IDs as expected, possibly even better than you expected :-)</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hardcoded_path_separator_breaking_windows_builds">Hardcoded path separator breaking windows builds</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve received reports that the Windows users' builds had been failing due to a hardcoded backtick in the codebase. We&#8217;ve resolved this issue, and the code has become platform-agnostic, feel free to use it on any operating system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_hardcoded_webpack_peer_dependency_version">Hardcoded Webpack peer dependency version</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users who wanted to use a different version of Webpack from the one provided by the federation dashboard plugin, previously had to use a force command to install due to unmet peer dependencies. The dependency requirement for Webpack has now been updated to ^5.40.0, allowing users to install the desired version, within reason, without using a force command.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Federation is a technique that allows developers to split a large web application into smaller, independent modules that can be loaded on demand. The concept of Module Federation was first introduced by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zackary-jackson-81845a35/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zack Jackson</a>. He later wrote a book on <a href="https://module-federation.myshopify.com/products/practical-module-federation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Module Federation</a> written together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jherr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Herrington</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Federation works by using a "host" application that is responsible for loading and managing the various modules. The host application loads the modules asynchronously and communicates with them using a shared interface. This allows the modules to interact with each other and share data and functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Federation is a relatively new technology that is gaining popularity among developers as it allows for more modular, performant, and scalable web applications. It is not specific to any frontend framework and can be used with popular frameworks such as Next.js, React, Angular, and Vue. In addition, module Federation can also be used with Node.js itself for Federation of server code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this blog post, we will be discussing the business value of Module Federation. Specifically, we will look at how modularity and scalability can benefit businesses by reducing development time and costs, improving maintainability and flexibility.</p>

<h2 id="_some_of_the_business_values_and_impacts">Some of the business values and impacts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Federation allows for more modular and scalable web applications by enabling developers to break down a large codebase into smaller, reusable pieces that can be loaded and updated separately. This flexibility and ability to ship code allows developers to work on individual parts of the application independently, which can reduce development time and costs. It also reduces risk due to the fact that smaller segments of functionality can be tested as functionality is being deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, the modularity of Module Federation can also improve the maintainability and flexibility of the application. Because each module is self-contained and has its own dependencies, it is easier to update and maintain individual modules without affecting the rest of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Module Federation can also increase developer autonomy by allowing developers to work on their own modules without having to coordinate with the rest of the team as they did when working with monolithic applications. This can lead to faster development and a more efficient workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resilience of the application is also increased by allowing portions of the web application to be unavailable without impacting the entire application. This can be particularly useful for applications that need to be highly available, as it allows for better handling of outages and maintenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Module Federation often reduces the bundle size of the application by reducing the amount of code that needs to be shipped to the browser on the first interaction. This can improve the performance of the application and can also be beneficial for search engine optimization (SEO) as it reduces the amount of code that needs to be parsed by the browser.</p>

<h2 id="_whos_using_module_federation">Who&#8217;s using Module Federation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is public information available that many large and recognizable organizations are using Module Federation in their web applications. Some examples of well-known companies that have adopted Module Federation include PayPal, Best Buy, Lululemon, Semrush, Cloudflare, Epic Games, Business Insider, Box.com, Shopify, Adidas, Fidelity, Bytedance, and Chase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These companies have likely implemented Module Federation to achieve greater modularity and scalability in their web applications, which we can expect to contribute to the success of their web presence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is worth noting that these are just a few examples of the many organizations that are using Module Federation. There are likely many other companies, both large and small, that are using Module Federation internally or externally in their web applications. This demonstrates the widespread adoption of Module Federation as a powerful tool for building modular and scalable web applications.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a development organization is looking for a technique that allows developers to split a large, monolithic, web application into smaller, independent modules that can be loaded on demand, Module Federation is the way to go. The reduced development time and costs, improved maintainability and flexibility, increased developer autonomy, increased application resilience, and reduced bundle size are just the beginning of the benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve shared, Module Federation has already been adopted by many well-known organizations, and it is likely that more companies will adopt it in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is clear that business should try to stay up-to-date with new technologies and begin to leverage Module Federation, we know it will help them to stay competitive.</p>

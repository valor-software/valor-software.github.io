<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;re living in the golden age of software development, and open-source libraries are a
huge part of the software revolution that we&#8217;re facing now. That&#8217;s why I felt the need to talk about it now. I, as
an Automation QA, got experience in testing open-source libraries and wanted to share my thoughts with everybody,
because such type of projects requires a slightly different testing approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All examples shown in this article are based solely on my experience testing <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ngx-bootstrap</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ngx-bootstrap</a> is a set of Bootstrap components, powered by Angular, which developers can quickly integrate into their projects.
Each UI component has specific reconfigurable properties/inputs/outputs, which makes the library very interesting
for us in terms of gaining testing experience. Okay, now it becomes a bit confusing with all those properties and
inputs. To make things clear, let&#8217;s go through all project roles first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Project roles in open source universe</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Customer</strong> The primary consumer of an open-source library is usually a simple
developer. In most cases, a developer is trying to implement not his own, but customer&#8217;s wishes. What it
means for us, is that testing engineer can&#8217;t directly get requirements from an appropriate person, who
knows 100% how new features should function. This results a few pros and cons:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PROS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have many customers (in our case - developers), and you can contact each of them directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your customer is usually smart and can know much more about the new feature request/issue that you can
imagine. It gives QA possibilities to grow and to learn much new stuff, especially related to web
development, different technologies, new software solutions, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All your customers are from different countries, who speak different languages, and most importantly -
they have different wishes. All this gives QA the possibility to make a unique and universal instrument,
like Datepicker locales: everyone needs it, but we have many different languages with different
parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CONS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have tons of feature requests/issues/bugs, all of which need to be appropriately structured and
implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature requests could be conflicting. They could be hard to implement and test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A customer could create an issue and forget about it. This bug could be without any details, specific
description, clarifying information, which QA usually expects in order to reproduce the issue. Also, in
the end, this bug could be not a bug at all, but just a misunderstanding on how to use the library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Developer</strong><br>
Not all open-source libraries are developed and supported by developers, who are directly interested in the development, as <a href="https://twitter.com/ladyleet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tracy Lee</a> said in one of our discussions:</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Companies now support open source. Like Valor, for example, because a lot of people think open
source is just random people doing it, but really it&#8217;s actually supported by companies</em>.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is true, and the main point here is that the leading development team knows the quality assurance team,
and we regularly collaborate as in the usual project. However, from time to time, your developer could be an
undefined person from the other side of the planet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PROS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open source project grows rapidly and exponentially, depending on how many developers are involved in
working on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QA can directly interact with developers who share their experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CONS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open source for developers, in most cases, is just an initiative: the response to a question or comment
may be delayed due to higher priorities of an actual and paid job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to have rules, style guides, linters, which are correctly described and easy to find. BUT, the
initial setup to support typical code/commit/doc style, etc., requires a lot of time and force. This may
not be a minus if you already have such rules or a standardized approach to their setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>QA</strong><br>
Maybe you will laugh now, but the main testers of an open source library are the
developers :) Yeah, well, that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re the primary users, and they will try to use your library
with different OSs, environments, browsers, type of apps, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PROS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>QA needs to act as a developer, use your lib in real app code, test all new changes related to library
source in already prepared test projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, QA needs to review the code, parts of which have been changed (those parts could be broken, or
their behavior could have changed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CONS:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This activity could be boring and very hard for a manual tester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the library is too small, then the QA Engineer can take over the responsibilities of an analyst,
project manager, and even the developer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Testing process overview</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on differences in project participants, it is logical
to assume that the testing process itself will be very specific. It&#8217;s true. We can describe the testing stages
in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>1.Testing New Issues.</strong> Before including issue/request/bug to the
current iteration/milestone QA needs to investigate all other related cards (link them together if they exist)
and perform a requirements testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>2. Pull Requests (PR) Testing</strong>. When the
developer completes a new task, QA needs to clone all new changes locally, build the library, and perform
testing of a new feature, which includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requirements testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual feature testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoke regression testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration testing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3. Automated testing</strong>. PR testing also can include any automated tests (if they&#8217;re not
included to the CI, duh). If new PR broke automated tests, then QA teams up with a developer in a tighter bond
to investigate failures and fix them. QA helps to cover new functionality with unit tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>4. Integration pre-release testing</strong> Integration pre-release testing is performed only before creating
a new release. It includes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Smoke checking for the entire DEMO application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking for full workability of all components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration testing of the whole library (including testing of a new version of the library in integration
with other test projects). <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&#8217;s</a> a very useful tip for it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>5. Integration post-release testing</strong> is performed only after release is published (could be
@latest, @next, with/without breaking changes). Usually performed in test libraries (TODO-APP or HELLO WORLD
apps that can be tested for compatibility, sometimes via ng new), which are using the latest version of the
current library.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_documentation_examples_for_open_source_libraries"><strong>Documentation examples for open-source libraries</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main goal of a new QA on the project is to make it maximum qualitative for the minimum time (as it could be
something else :D). And the first step in the qualitative direction is documentation. In a perfect world, a
docset should include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Issue Template</a> - helps new contributors in creating issues in a standardized way and describes what should be done before/now/after creating a new issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pull Request Template</a> - helps new contributors in
applying appropriate changes to the codebase with the same code style, approach, and describes the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contributing Guide</a> - describes what types of issues/feature requests/pull requests exist, how to pull/commit/push changes, contains useful links and
answers for the frequent questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">README</a> - contains essential links, info on how to clone, install,
build, use, and make changes to the library. This info is always shown on the main GitHub repo page, so it
should contain the maximum amount of useful information, treat it as your landing page. Our advice would
be to follow <a href="https://www.makeareadme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeareadme.com</a> instructions on how to maintain an excellent README for your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changelog</a> - contains information about versions, releases, changes that were included to each release. A changelog is very important to developers, who wait for some fixes/features, that&#8217;s why it should not be empty. Our advice would be to follow <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keepachangelog.com</a> instructions on how to maintain an excellent
changelog for your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiki</a> - a great place to accumulate all links and other useful info.</p>

understand how specific functionality should work, helps QAs to cover application with automated tests,
check test coverage percentage, and to manually test the library and then prepare a summary with testing
results.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tech Stack for automated testing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unit tests: <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karma</a> + <a href="https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jasmine</a>
are our tools of choice for automated tests. Our approach consists of two major rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Unit tests should be written for each new change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be no Pull Requests merged to development branch without tests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two simple rules give dev team at least some kind of confidence that the code will work adequately
(its development, we can never be sure about something working 100% right). If new contributors create PRs
without unit tests, then other participants or QAs could (should, in a perfect world) help and do everything
the right way. <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/codecov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecov</a> is a bot for GitHub that helps to get rid of
developers PRs without any tests attached, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter</a> is a code coverage
tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>E2E tests: <a href="https://cypress.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress</a>.
This type of test covers the user behavior for each demo page and demo component. Full coverage with such
tests helps to decrease the time for manual pre-release and post-release testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Anything else what QA&#8217;s should pay attention to? Sure!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t spend much time for reproducing a poorly described issue. A much better approach would be to ask the
author about the details directly. Many contributors ignore any recommendations and issue templates,
providing so little info without confirmation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://stackblitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stackblitz</a>, <a href="https://plnkr.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plunker</a> or any other online
IDE (<a href="https://github.com/styfle/awesome-online-ide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of them!</a>), which can easily share projects between people
for the reproduction of issues/requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build priorities for next releases according to the most popular issues/requests inside a repository, as
fixing issues that users demand highly increases usage auditory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before creating a new release with colossal change/new functionality, be sure that it doesn&#8217;t break other
components/services. Ask your collaborators and users about this in your public channels (Slack, Twitter,
Telegram, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many paid services/libraries/tools are ready to provide free plans for Open Source. It gives the
development team more possibilities for promotion. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask the related team for cooperation
"we&#8217;re all in the same boat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>PS:</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Testing open source libraries is a little bit different from testing other projects, at
a minimum it requires additional knowledge, which is based on those technologies, which are used in current
lib. However, it gives each involved engineer a possibility to grow much faster than in other projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>P.P.S</em></p>

<p>Thank you, the one who contributes to the Open Source. Together we can make the world a

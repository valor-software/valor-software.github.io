<p>Hi! My name is Angelina, and I&#8217;m a DevOps Engineer at Valor Software. With the help
of this article, we&#8217;ll set up your GCP environment to work in tandem with Terraform. I&#8217;ll guide you through the
setup of a basic cluster. For this, I picked the services that I use daily within my DevOps routine, since they are
optimal for your typical project setup. Let me explain myself here! By typical I mean common projects that are
natural (habitual) for your company or industry. In this case, I bet you&#8217;d appreciate a chance to build the
environment once and clone it for future projects. That&#8217;s exactly the way you can go with the services I offer
below. So, once you learn the basics for the project setup in this stack, you&#8217;ll be able to run new ones in the
cloud in no time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we
need to set up a cloud infrastructure for the project, we want to make it quickly. That&#8217;s when automation tools
come
to help. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a> is one of the instruments that
serve for automated setup, and it is compatible with more than 70 providers, which is beyond handy. Besides,
Terraform is pretty straightforward to get along with thanks to its declarative language. You don&#8217;t need to get
used
to a completely different CLI, like in cases when you switch to another cloud provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why I suggest
picking Terraform from the great variety of services is because it&#8217;s perfect for creating reusable
infrastructures.
You can also clone the existing infrastructure and apply it to your next project, with small alterations if
needed.
This benefit of reusability, together with the security that Terraform provides, makes it a first-choice
technology
for solving my daily tasks. BTW, it&#8217;s also the right place for keeping electronic keys and hidden or encrypted
variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another good point is that Terraform allows for managing several cloud infrastructures
from different providers in parallel with minimal time and effort spent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll lead
you through setting up infrastructure on Google Cloud using Terraform, so buckle up!</p>

<h3 id="_kubernetes_on_google_cloud_platform"><strong>Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform</strong></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being one of the native Google products, Kubernetes is integrated
into GCP quite as is, with no alterations. So you can conveniently set it up and manage it through the GCP CLI
or
with the help of external instruments like Terraform.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create a new directory for the
project and create a main.tf file for the Terraform config, and populate it with the following content:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>provider "google" {
    credentials = file("CREDENTIALS_FILE.json")
    project = "your-project"
    region = "us-west1"
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we jump to the next step of creating a configuration file, we should remember to keep data (e.g.
keys, project names) in separate files. This way we ensure project security and give ourselves a chance to reuse
the configuration in the future. So, locate the project name, region, and credentials file in a separate file
with variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, create a variables.tf file and declare variables for it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    variable "credentials" {
        type = string
    }

    variable "project" {
        type = string
    }

    variable "region" {
        type = string
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add the variables' values to secrets.tfvars:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>credentials = "CREDENTIALS_FILE.json"
project     = "your-project"
region      = "us-west1"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then format your main.tf file like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>provider  "google" {
    credentials = file(var.credentials)
    project     = var.project
    region      = var.region
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, when your variables are safe, you&#8217;ll be able to pick the needed files with variables instead of
repeatedly typing in new data in the main file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the <code><em>terraform init</em></code> command,
you&#8217;re pulling up modules that you will need to proceed with further steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>terraform init</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see this message, it&#8217;s a success! Hurray!</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Terraform has been initialised!</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the next step, you add variables to the variables.tf file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    variable "cluster_name" {
      type = string
    }

    variable "cluster_zone" {
        type = string
    }

    variable "app_name" {
        type = string
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before creating a cluster, you should first add variables describing this particular cluster to the secrets.tfvars file:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>cluster_name = “cluster-1”
cluster_zone = “us-west1-a”
app_name = “test”</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now add the cluster configuration to your main.tf file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    resource "google_container_cluster" "cluster-1" {
      name =  var.cluster_name
      location =  var.cluster_zone
      initial_node_count = 3
      node_config {
         labels = {
          app = var.app_name
          }

        tags = ["app", var.app_name]
      }

      timeouts {
        create = "30m"
        update = "40m"
      }
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the configuration, you define the cluster&#8217;s name, its location, and the number of nodes and their
labels. The default namespace is the place where you create a cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To operate with the
cluster and its components conveniently, you need to create an output.tf file, where you&#8217;ll add variables that
will be displayed after running the <code><em>terraform apply</em></code> command. You can use them later by calling them
during configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>output "cluster" {  value = google_container_cluster.cluster-1.name}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now add a new resource which is deployment:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    resource "kubernetes_deployment" "example" {
        metadata {
            name = "terraform-example"
            labels = {
                app = var.app_name
            }
        }

      spec {
        replicas = 3

        selector {
          match_labels = {
           app = var.app_name
          }
        }

        template {
          metadata {
            labels = {
             app = var.app_name
            }
          }

          spec {
            container {
              image = "nginx:1.7.8"
              name  = "example"

              resources {
                limits = {
                  cpu = "0.5"
                  memory = "512Mi"
                }
                requests = {
                  cpu = "250m"
                  memory = "50Mi"
                }
              }

              liveness_probe {
                http_get {
                  path = "/"
                  port = 80

                  http_header {
                    name  = "X-Custom-Header"
                    value = "Awesome"
                  }
                }

                initial_delay_seconds = 3
                period_seconds = 3
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the deployment configuration, you specify the number of replicas, tags, labels, an image that we&#8217;re
going to use, as well as internal resources. Finally, you have it all ready for the first launch and go with
this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>terraform plan -var-file=secrets.tfvars</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this way, you check if the configuration is created properly and if you&#8217;re satisfied with the range of
resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re quite sure that everything is correct, it&#8217;s time for the <code><em>terraform apply</em></code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>terraform apply -var-file=secrets.tfvars</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And don&#8217;t forget to specify the file with variables! At this stage, you&#8217;ll have to confirm your actions by
running a <code><em>yes</em></code> command. Terraform will build your new GKE cluster on GCP. After the cluster is
created, you&#8217;ll see the output list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For your convenience, in the future, you can split the
config file into a few separate files. Place the provider block in the providers.tf file, and a
"google_container_cluster" block” in the cluster.tf file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_good_job"><strong>Good job!</strong></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;re almost done with your journey, the cluster is up and running, and you
can be (ugh) proud of yourself!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For your future projects, you&#8217;ll be able to add more metrics
and parameters when creating a resource. This will help you adjust your configuration for solving every
particular task.</p>

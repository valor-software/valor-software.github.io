<p>We love tools that automate our work - we can do more with fewer efforts, season it with
some open-source love and, oh boy, we&#8217;re gonna use it for sure. However, open-source software is a
community-driven approach, there may be hardly any information about it on the internet or no insights at all. If
you face errors that cannot be solved or don&#8217;t have enough understanding of the tool while exploring, you can give
up on the tool without discovering all its useful features.</p>

<p>We want to delve into two possible synchronization issues you may face while working with <a href="http://www.protractortest.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protractor</a> - an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS apps. The good news is that there&#8217;s official documentation from the Protractor team, but the bad news is that it didn&#8217;t help us to solve these issues, so we&#8217;ll share the solution we came up with.</p>

<h2 id="_waiting_for_angular_timeout_error">"Waiting for Angular" timeout error</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Asynchronous and multicomponent WebDriver tests may cause various timeout errors in a Protractor test. One of
them can be the "Waiting for Angular" error. Here&#8217;s the information from <a href="http://www.protractortest.org/#/timeouts#how-to-disable-waiting-for-angular" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protractor&#8217;s Documentation</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Before performing any action, Protractor waits until there are no pending asynchronous tasks in your
Angular application. This means that all timeouts and HTTP requests are finished.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>An error in your test results will look like this:&amp;nbsp Timed out waiting for asynchronous Angular
tasks to finish after 11 seconds.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Default timeout: 11 seconds</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How to change: Add allScriptsTimeout: timeout_in_millis to your Protractor configuration file.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You may also need to fix this problem by investigating and fixing an issue on the application level.</em></p>

<h4 id="_angularjs"><em>AngularJS</em></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>If your AngularJS application continuously polls $timeout or $http, Protractor will wait indefinitely and
time out. To fix infinite timeout, you should use the</em> <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/interval.js"><em>$interval</em></a> <em>for
anything that polls continuously (<strong>Note:</strong> $interval was introduced in
Angular 1.2rc3).</em></p>

<p>Needless to say that using open-source tools makes our lives easier. Unfortunately, when working with a new
tool, you may often face various issues and don&#8217;t have the right example of fixing them. Lack of exhaustive
documentation and speedy support can be challenging at times.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specializing in Angular web development, we need to find more and more relevant best practices to follow.
Earlier, we talked about <a href="https://valor-software.com/persons/ludmila-nesvitiy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress
testing</a>, and in this article we dived into synchronization issues that might occur while testing
Angular-based apps with <a href="http://www.protractortest.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protractor</a>.</p>

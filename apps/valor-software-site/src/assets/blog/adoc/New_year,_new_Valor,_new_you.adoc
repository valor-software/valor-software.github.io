A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Valor Software once worked in an
apartment-like office, like any great startup before it. It's the Slavic rendition of working from a garage. As
time flew Valor moved to a more spacious place, located near a very brutalist-looking building (see pictures
below) and very close to the second most famous Circus in Kharkiv. The benefits were outstanding We enjoyed great
architecture during lunchtime when the sun shined its luxurious rays, illuminating the kinda evil looking
building. We also enjoyed, maybe just a bit too much, the tiger roars during work time.

We loved being close to animals to such an extent that we adopted 3 beautiful cats, our own mini
tigers, which turned out to be one of the most efficient workplace sellers for us. Alas, we've outgrown our
two-winged castle. At the end of the day, we had to find a place as homey as our previous "home".

Moving to a new space, our founders wanted to make each and every single Valorian felt
comfortable. This office is an extension of their internal feeling of coziness, calm, and inspiration. Let's
be honest, who would want to create art (code, obviously, is art if not wizardry most of the time) when stuck
in an elevator 36 inches wide and 48 inches deep? Nobody asked for a panic attack!

While modern companies try to bribe engineers with the latest and greatest furniture,
Michelin-starred dishes, and treadmills that actually run for the runner, Valor keeps it simple. There's no
point in finding out how to make people stay late and away from their families. They might or might not do it,
depending on their will. Office perks have nothing to do with it. Same with making people stay longer in the
company. It's not a matter of eloquent vacancies, no. It takes years and years of earning the trust of your
employees by acting as a normal human being, not like some kind of corporate robot.

Now back to the actual news! The benefits and pleasures that come with the new office are still there, and they serve
exceptionally as the working conditions enhancement. Valorians might want to warm up or have a good stretch,
then they go to a massage room or a gym. Those highly spiritual ones may have a dynamic yoga session, then go
back to work renewed. It's all in the new office!

It sounds pretty reasonable that seeing a horizon or at least the ability to see far in front of
you relaxes eyes and delivers a new portion of dopamine to your brain. We loved seeing tigers, lions, and
horses from our windows before, but the beauty of the urban horizon is truly something else. This all brings
ideas.

Remember those cats we adopted earlier on? They deserve a separate space in our lives and in this
piece of text. The three of them, warm, loving, and constantly looking for visitors will be glad if you check
on them on the third floor. No appointment required.

Meeting rooms? We have them! In case you
adore rough but sweet cinematic spaces and even more space for negotiation and self-expression, you'd love it
in Valor Software.

A good thing about our office life is that Valor is always vibrating and evolving. As more people
join, the rainbow gets new shades and twists. Everyone can contribute with whatever it is they are good at.
This way, we technically have a fine arts gallery conceptual enough to be exhibited in Pinchuck art center.
Everyone who knows how to hold a camera (now everyone knows since everyone is a creator, it's a special time
to live) may share their works and virtually bring us to the most abandoned places on earth. If you have a
blog, we'll subscribe. If you share things in your channel, wait no more, share it, and you'll have followers.
If you shoot TikToks, sorry then, no one can help you with that. Better consider rap or gardening. Hopefully,
you've got a feeling that self-expression is another lively aspect Valor supports. That's the idea of this
paragraph.

=== Plans

You should never underestimate food. So, while our main dining area on the
first floor gets final transformations, we have another one at your service. With chairs comfortable enough to
have three courses in a row and tables long enough to retain that precious personal space while eating.

Also, we pay special attention to a conference space to make it soundproof, roomy, cozy, and
good-looking. Wait for it, and you'll see this epic concrete-seasoned location ready for visitors on the
ground floor.

Finally, for those who feel more confused than excited about surprises, Valor's
founders are making a surprise Valorians have been hinting on! Smart, right? No one knows what it is exactly,
so, we'll make another article as a follow-up to this one with the latest and greatest updates and happy
faces.

What is it that you're missing at your current place? Feel free to share, and it's highly
possible that Valor Software already offers this for years and years :-)

Conclusions:

Well, we all prefer different places, styles, furniture, illumination,
decor, coffee, and cats. But when we organize the place thinking of people who will reside there, or at least
spend some time, our chances for success are close to 100. Same as with software, you've got to gather
clients' requirements, and then form your requirements to the product to satisfy needs of the target audience.
When the target audience includes you, since you're going to work from the same office, the task is easier.
You've got it!

Pieces of advice to organize the place you'll enjoy staying at:

* pick the place you like
* think of people you'll share the place with
* make a list of use cases
* make a plan of how to satisfy essential needs
* add uniqueness on the top вЂ” your personal preferences
* make it happen!

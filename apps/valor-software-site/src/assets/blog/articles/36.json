  "seoDescription": "I needed to create a simple web app with a Grammarly-like view that counts paragraphs, sentences, words, and characters in a text. The best thing is that you can copy-paste text from various resources like websites, Google Docs, MS Office, email clients, get it analyzed. But since external content contains a lot of redundant HTML tags, which influences the correctness of calculations, I came up with the solution for cleaning HTML."

  "seoDescription": "Hopefully, you had a chance to learn the background of the project from the previous part — about what came before the decision of incorporating user research. Now time for a brief preparation part! At first, I had learned about the people analytics field and became savvier. Then I prepared a list of questions to discuss in the interview, but it was more like a cheat sheet because it was not a formal interview, more like a semi-formal one."

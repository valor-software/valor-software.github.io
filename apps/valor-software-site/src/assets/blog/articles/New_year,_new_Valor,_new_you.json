It's the Slavic rendition of working from a garage. As time flew Valor moved to a more\n        spacious place, located near a very brutalist-looking building (see pictures below) and very close to the second\n        most famous Circus in Kharkiv. The benefits were outstanding We enjoyed great architecture during lunchtime when\n        the sun shined its luxurious rays, illuminating the kinda evil looking building. We also enjoyed, maybe just a\n        bit too much, the tiger roars during work time.<br></p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:1148px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606dadf2c9f500855a20e8d3_01.png\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>The circus for the show that must go on</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>We loved being close to animals to such an extent that we adopted 3 beautiful cats, our own mini tigers,\n    which turned out to be one of the most efficient workplace sellers for us. Alas, we've outgrown our two-winged\n    castle. At the end of the day, we had to find a place as homey as our previous \"home\".<br></p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:842px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/6033bcdcd3b25b24f24cae3a_DHfmb6mcHISxljiIFaoAX0785gPX5GEdbypAK8ZD6exZh4e4zCSIcpClUQEhdJHvwLNkDmodFNU7Klg9_axOQ205e5Vh8kNYvW7DYH58MgyKzjfDUFlhJZ3JuwVjMmIt_YbMA7qD.png\"\n        width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>PJSC \"Ukrtelecom\"</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>Moving to a new space, our founders wanted to make each and every single Valorian felt comfortable. This\n    office is an extension of their internal feeling of coziness, calm, and inspiration. Let's be honest, who would want\n    to create art (code, obviously, is art if not wizardry most of the time) when stuck in an elevator 36 inches wide\n    and 48 inches deep? Nobody asked for a panic attack!</p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606da136e4ec3cff5fce5412_01%202.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>The three cats (Valor's angels)</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>While modern companies try to bribe engineers with the latest and greatest furniture, Michelin-starred\n    dishes, and treadmills that actually run for the runner, Valor keeps it simple. There's no point in finding out\n    how to make people stay late and away from their families. They might or might not do it, depending on their will.\n    Office perks have nothing to do with it. Same with making people stay longer in the company. It's not a matter of\n    eloquent vacancies, no. It takes years and years of earning the trust of your employees by acting as a normal human\n    being, not like some kind of corporate robot.<br></p>\n    <p>Now back to the actual news! The benefits and pleasures that come with the new office are still there, and they\n        serve exceptionally as the working conditions enhancement. Valorians might want to warm up or have a good\n        stretch, then they go to a massage room or a gym. Those highly spiritual ones may have a dynamic yoga session,\n        then go back to work renewed. It's all in the new office!</p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606dbd812f4360551885236f_8.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>Massage room</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>It sounds pretty reasonable that seeing a horizon or at least the ability to see far in front of you\n    relaxes eyes and delivers a new portion of dopamine to your brain. We loved seeing tigers, lions, and horses from\n    our windows before, but the beauty of the urban horizon is truly something else. This all brings ideas.&nbsp <br>\n</p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606da484a9bccc702014f2f0_2.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>City view from the terrace</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>Remember those cats we adopted earlier on? They deserve a separate space in our lives and in this piece\n    of text. The three of them, warm, loving, and constantly looking for visitors will be glad if you check on them on\n    the third floor. No appointment required.<br></p>\n    <p>Meeting rooms? We have them! In case you adore rough but sweet cinematic spaces and even more space for\n        negotiation and self-expression, you'd love it in Valor Software.</p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606da6be5990f00f0babd77d_3.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>Meeting room</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>A good thing about our office life is that Valor is always vibrating and evolving. As more people join,\n    the rainbow gets new shades and twists. Everyone can contribute with whatever it is they are good at. This way, we\n    technically have a fine arts gallery conceptual enough to be exhibited in Pinchuck art center. Everyone who knows\n    how to hold a camera (now everyone knows since everyone is a creator, it's a special time to live) may share their\n    works and virtually bring us to the most abandoned places on earth. If you have a blog, we'll subscribe. If you\n    share things in your channel, wait no more, share it, and you'll have followers. If you shoot TikToks, sorry then,\n    no one can help you with that. Better consider rap or gardening. Hopefully, you've got a feeling that\n    self-expression is another lively aspect Valor supports. That's the idea of this paragraph.<br></p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:1280px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/6033bcdfd3b25b69734cafd8_KCYGvZ8DleX_oRI2rzok0Yhf5mvKKrCSOCKJ3Y6kwBlJTiTVkF4hCbHgWr2PwVYQGDSUdvUuB7h5E4HbUPm2FT0iRHh29vvLWgweYqWxThJWku258BcaRvCR4vj4jXjcJOtkPV1K.png\"\n        width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>Holy Annunciation Cathedral</figcaption>\n    </figure><h3>Plans<br></h3>\n    <p>You should never underestimate food. So, while our main dining area on the first floor gets final\n        transformations, we have another one at your service. With chairs comfortable enough to have three courses in a\n        row and tables long enough to retain that precious personal space while eating.<br></p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606daab198ab98e55f44292c_4.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>Temporary canteen and the gorgeous stairs</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>Also, we pay special attention to a conference space to make it soundproof, roomy, cozy, and\n    good-looking.

Smart, right? No one knows what it is exactly, so, we'll make another article\n        as a follow-up to this one with the latest and greatest updates and happy faces.</p>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606dab2400e8a37778ad44b5_5.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>Co-working space</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>What is it that you're missing at your current place?

But when we\n        organize the place thinking of people who will reside there, or at least spend some time, our chances for\n        success are close to 100. Same as with software, you've got to gather clients' requirements, and then form your\n        requirements to the product to satisfy needs of the target audience. When the target audience includes you,\n        since you're going to work from the same office, the task is easier. You've got it!</p>\n    <p>Pieces of advice to organize the place you'll enjoy staying at:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>pick the place you like</li>\n        <li>think of people you'll share the place with</li>\n        <li>make a list of use cases</li>\n        <li>make a plan of how to satisfy essential needs</li>\n        <li>add uniqueness on the top вЂ” your personal preferences</li>\n        <li>make it happen!</li>\n    </ul>\n    <figure class=\" w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\n    \" style=\"max-width:2747px\">\n    <div><img src=\" https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c4c30d0c49ea6746fafc90c/606dacf49eb5732c22236489_7.jpg\"\n        loading=\"lazy\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\">\n    </div>\n    <figcaption>How would cozy look like</figcaption>\n    </figure><p>P.S.

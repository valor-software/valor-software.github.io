One of SPA's (single page application) issues is poor indexing in search engines and
search optimization in general. Specifically, because Ð¡lient-side rendering typical for JavaScript SPAs isn't
optimal for SEO. Indexing crawlers may not always run the JavaScript code so the content may remain ignored. That
is why you should implement https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web#server-rendering[SSR (server-side rendering)^] to render the content on the server rather than on the client side, thus, help the crawlers index it.

Another part of SEO activities for web application development that can be managed by the programmer is improving the site info appearance in Google earch results so it catches the eye. Structured info blocks draw the user's attention better than an unordered piece of text. Google provides a set of rules on creating neat text snippets - this is what we'll talk about in this article.

As you might notice, we at Valor Software love Angular ), not to mention that
it's one of the three most popular JavaScript frameworks. In this article, we're going to mimic building an
Angular app template, so be ready to dive into some code examples.

== What is Structured data?

Structured data
is a format for presenting data suggested by https://schema.org[schema.org^] standards. When you create app components using a Structured data format, you'll be able to customize the search results view. The search robots parse the structured data and show your site in a more detailed and organized view, as https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery[rich snippets (also known as rich results)^]. Also, the more organized the data structure is (in this context, according to the Structured data principles), the better your chances are to improve your rankings.

*Note:* Using Structured data is an additional instrument to
create an SEO-friendly app, while applying standard SEO features like meta descriptions or title tags is still
crucial.

Google Search supports three formats of Structured data (https://json-ld.org[JSON-LD^], https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata[Microdata^], https://rdfa.info[RDFa^]), but recommends using JSON-LD.
Moreover, this format suits SPA development the best since Google can read JSON-LD data when it's dynamically
injected into the page's contents, particularly by JavaScript. While Microdata and RDFa make use of
characteristic HTML tag attributes.

== How to use Structured data?
=== Preliminary work

While the crawlers are unfriendly to dynamic content and SPAs are dynamically generated by JavaScript on the
fly, SEO for SPAs seems to be an issue. However, we have an SSR to assist us. With the help of SSR, web
crawlers get not only an index.html file with the app-root component but a pre-generated HTML page with the
entire component delivered by the SSR mechanism.

*Note:* The solution
(specifically, code examples) we describe in this article won't work if SSR isn't going to be set up for your
project. In the case of Angular applications as a topic of this article, we recommend that you build the
server-side rendering part using the most popular SSR technology for Angular - https://angular.io/guide/universal[Universal^].

=== Adding JSON-LD format

To use JSON-LD format in your code, you'll usually add a &lt script&gt tag in the
page head or body. However, since Angular removes any &lt script&gt tags from templates, you'll need to
utilize DOMSanitizer service. You'll notice how &lt script type="application/ld+json"&gt is interpreted via
getSafeHTML in our example of injecting JSON-LD as a component:

    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { productLD } from '../product';
    @Component({
        selector: 'app-my-json-ld',
        template: '<div [innerHTML]="html"></div>',
        styles: []
    })
    export class MyJsonLdComponent implements OnInit {
        itemLD = productLD;
        html: SafeHtml;
        constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }
        ngOnInit() {
            this.html = this.getSafeHTML(this.itemLD);
        }
        getSafeHTML(jsonLD: {[key: string]: any}): SafeHtml {
            const json = jsonLD ? JSON.stringify(jsonLD, null, 2).replace(/<\/script>/g, '<\\/script>') : '';
            // escape / to prevent script tag in JSON
            const html = `<script type="application/ld+json">${json}</script>`;
            return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(html);
        }
    }

Another option of implementing JSON-LD format in your project is to insert https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-lite/json-ld[@ngx-lite/json-ld^] component created by https://twitter.com/coryrylan[Cory Rylan^], Google Developer Expert for Angular and Web.

=== Building Structured data

So, applying Structure data format
is all about achieving a user-friendly data view in search results - less but well-structured info is better
than presenting all the available details.

Here's an example of the well-structured snippet for
product details:

    export const productLD = {
        "@context": "http://schema.org/",
        "@type": "Product",
        "name": "Some tech product",
        "image": "http://lorempixel.com/output/technics-q-c-640-480-3.jpg",
        "description": "Descriprion for tech product.",
        "mpn": "123450",
        "brand": {
            "@type": "Thing",  "name": "Brand Name"
        },
        "aggregateRating": {
            "@type": "AggregateRating",
            "ratingValue": 5,
            "reviewCount": 50
        },
        "offers": [
            {
                "@type": "Offer",
                "availability": "InStock",
                "priceCurrency": "USD",

                "priceValidUntil": "2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z"
            },
            {
                "@type": "Offer",
                "availability": "InStock",
                "priceCurrency": "USD",
                "price": 9.99,
                "url": "http://lorempixel.com/output/technics-q-c-640-480-1.jpg",
                "sku": 9998,
                "mpn": "123457",
                "priceValidUntil": "2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z"
            },
            {
                "@type": "Offer",
                "availability": "InStock",
                "priceCurrency": "USD",
                "price": 9.99,
                "url": "http://lorempixel.com/output/technics-q-c-640-480-2.jpg",
                "sku": 9997,
                "mpn": "123458",
                "priceValidUntil": "2020-07-05T00:00:00.000Z"
            }
        ],
        "sku": 1234,"review": {
            "@type": "Review",
            "author": "John S.",
            "reviewBody": "Really good product, can't wait to order one more."
        }
    }

=== Testing the result

You might wonder how your website would look like in search results. Google developers covered that as well.

https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/asciidoc_processor/1023004302050[Structured Data Testing Tool^] allows you to upload either a URL or a code snippet and check a search result preview even before deployment.

you to check up on the flawless site operation. If the report shows any issues, you can request a recrawl
after fixing them. Remember that recrawl can take up to several days.

== Conclusion

SEO and SPAs aren't good friends. Web applications built on JavaScript platforms perform worse in Google search results than websites delivering plain HTML to the crawler.

So if you're building a
JavaScript app, you'll need to help Google on ranking your site. Be sure to consider SSR and Structured data
formatting to adapt the result view of the site for different types of projects. Also, Structured data
formatting influences the search engine's understanding of content, therefore, it can help with relevance
signals. Besides, Google provides tools to test your results.

We showed the example of
building an Angular product description template according to Structured data principles. Go ahead and try
more rich snippets to represent features like articles or job postings.

We hope this helps
you build SEO-friendly Angular apps! :) If you have already implemented structured data, we'd love to hear
your feedback.

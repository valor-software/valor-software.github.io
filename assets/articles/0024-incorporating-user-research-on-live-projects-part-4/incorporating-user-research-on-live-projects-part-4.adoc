Check out the context, the preparation, and the actual research part with transcribing, diagraming and hints
on report in case you missed it. Now we have just a conclusion left to make. Thanks for following all the way
through the story!

== *Conclusion*

The research gave us an understanding of real user pains and needs. With the help of collected data, we may
produce better solutions to resolve those challenges our target audience meet in their daily routine. I have
learned tons of facts I couldn't previously imagine about the work of HRs and Team Managers. Gathered insights
could help us create a product that will be in demand and highly valuable for those ones who want to create
high-performance, profitable, healthy organizations.

The whole cycle вЂ” from preparation to insight report writing and gathering requirement to a new feature, took
about 3 weeks of work. The 4th one was the start of the wireframes creation phase.

*_Lessons learned_*

* Sharing with the team is crucial, and UX specialists should find the right words to translate collected
insights into design recommendations. I realized that in the future I should dedicate more time to present
the result to the development team.

* All the insights should be later transformed into user stories/jobs-to-be-done format so that the process
of user flow creation will be more accurate and easier to validate.

* In-depth user interviews and contextual inquiries uncover issues that can't be found out just by guerilla
studies (blogs, articles, and specific forums exploration), so advocating for this stage is necessary for
UX specialists. As a person responsible for product usage, we should find new strategies for getting a
user-centered approach into the development process, which means actually going out of the office and
talking to/observing users.

This journey was a great start to incorporating more UX methodology into already
existing product teams. I hope my experience will motivate you to start involving user studies in your project
and create products that will bring sensible value to the users.

  "seoDescription": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Valor Software once worked in an apartment-like office, like any great startup before it. As time flew Valor moved to a more spacious place, located near a very brutalist-looking building and very close to the second most famous Circus in Kharkiv. We loved being close to animals to such an extent that we adopted 3 beautiful cats, our own mini tigers, which turned out to be one of the most efficient workplace sellers for us. Alas, we've outgrown our two-winged castle."

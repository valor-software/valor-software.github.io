Hey, I'm Eduardo and I'm an Angular developer at Valor Software. Some time ago we
thought it would be useful to share some observations and discoveries we make while solving different issues. And
this time I'll contribute to "Valor Bites" short posts rubric with how I approached solving an MP3 tracks playing
issue.

*Playing stops before the end of the track*

While working on a 10 million-plus user meditation app, I ran into a very weird issue. While the Quality
Assurance team was trying to play a track, it would stop playing with around 13 seconds remaining and report as
completed. After some testing, it seems the issue was only happening when there was seeking involved. Playing
the whole track always ended at 0s remaining, pausing and playing had no impact either.

*Seeking within MP3*

Looking into the file format, I found it is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Design[MP3^]. There are many ways to seek within an
audio file. One way is to build an index of timestamps and byte offsets, like checkpoints in the track. Option
two is what MP3 does: nothing. MP3 has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Bit_rate[bitrate^],
so you seek it by multiplying bitrate with time. Want to seek 6.3 seconds in a 100 kbps file? – Jump to the
630kb position (small b here means bits, not bytes). Should be somewhat accurate, but a 10s+ difference seems a
bit too much. That is until you analyze the files:

    $ mpck ./track_with_issue.mp3
    SUMMARY: track_with_issue.mp3
    version                       MPEG v1.0
    layer                         3
    average bitrate               279491 bps (VBR)
    samplerate                    44100 Hz
    frames                        31503
    time                          13:42.935
    unidentified                  0 b (0%)
    errors                        none
    result                        Ok

    $ mpck ./track_with_issue.mp3
    SUMMARY: track_with_issue.mp3
    version                       MPEG v1.0
    layer                         3
    average bitrate               279491 bps (VBR)
    samplerate                    44100 Hz
    frames                        31503
    time                          13:42.935
    unidentified                  0 b (0%)
    errors                        none
    result                        Ok

Notice the first track has an Average Bitrate. Welcome to the marvelous world of VBR, also known as Variable Bit
Rate. MP3 encoded in VBR means you don’t know where exactly to seek to because the bitrate isn’t constant, so
you “guess” based on the average bit rate. Imagine you have 10 seconds of 100 kbps and 10 seconds of 200 kbps
bitrate in a single file. You have 100kbps from 0 to 1000kb and 200kbps from 1001 kb to 3000 kb. The average
bitrate is 150 kbps, but if you seek to 10 seconds using the previous formula, you’d seek to 1500 kb, which is
already in the 200 kbps part, jumping to about 12.5 seconds of the track. Also, note that if you inverted the
parts, you’d be at 7.5s.

Please, keep in mind that calculations have been simplified to make
them easier to understand and are not 100% accurate.

*Solution time!* +
So what could be done? – Well, the first obvious solution would be to just
re-encode it in MP3 with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_bitrate[CBR^]
(constant bit rate). The most elegant solution, though, is to drop MP3 completely and start using better audio
formats like Vorbis/Opus (.ogg), which have proper support for seeking. Thanks for attention! Hope to be
back with the next Bite soon :)

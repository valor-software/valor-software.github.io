Let’s take a closer look at the personalities of this cooperation, from not just a professional, but a personal
angle. One of&nbsp; *Zack Jackson’s* biggest goals, inspirations, and drivers for life is his
willingness to improve the developer experience. Being a person who invented Module Federation he has indeed
revolutionized the way of architecturing software. This methodology is now being adopted across the ecosystem by
organizations such as SAP and Google. Zack lives by the challenge that “nothing is impossible”! He’s started
living this challenge since his childhood in South Africa, where he managed to master programming despite the 2G
capability networks and other limitations. This gave him great empathy for users with low/no connectivity and
lower-powered devices.

Alongside a great passion for authoring code which he started at the age of 13. Zack finds joy and inspiration in
active leisure, riding his snowmobile, and going camping. Between cats and dogs, he’s definitely a dog person
and is the proud owner of a couple of French bulldogs.

*Dmitriy Shekhovtsov* describes himself as a JavaScript (NodeJS + Angular) addict and Software
architecture maniac. Being a person of a rather critical and rebellious nature, when working as an architect at
software development entities, he always noticed the procedural and communication flaws of most organizations.
Feeling there was a way of building and running the company more efficiently, Dmitriy organized Valor Software.
He’s managed to switch from the heartless format of IT manufacture to a living, vibrant, flat-structured
environment for engineers to offer bold and nonstandard ideas to realize clients’ vision and goals most smartly.

Passionate about open-source, Dmitriy has built Valor Software utilizing open-source technologies and
contributing back to the community with numerous open code libraries.

Dmitry is also a dog person, and not just a lover of his own pets, he sponsors and assists a local pet shelter,
with dozens of cats and dogs that needed financial support and additionally gave a safe home to three cats who
reside in our Kharkiv office. Between discussions and action, Dmitriy chooses action. Additionally, to unwind he
goes to play computer games, MMORPGs are his favourite. Last but not least Dmitriy is a family guy and loves to
spend time with his kids! :)

==== *Why this partnership is important*

In the fast-paced business environment, scalability is vital to succeeding as you can react to newly arisen
market and user demands instantly. Businesses can reach better scalability by splitting huge monolithic products
into smaller independently-manageable applications handled by isolated teams (free to take their own technical
decisions and make separate deployments). And Module Federation, as the continuation of the scalability
philosophy, allows to expose applications, particular functions, components, or contents and reuse them between
other apps.

No matter how massive your system is, MF will eventually allow you to deploy changes to all the applications in
one click without touching the codebase. _“I want universally uncoordinated, uncontrolled orchestration of
distributed code at runtime. That’s my ultimate goal!”_ – says Zack Jackson, describing the future he
sees for Module Federation. Among the primary objectives for this cooperation is building the ecosystem for
Module Federation and strengthening it as a backend technology.

For companies in time-pressured industries, moving from a monolith to the architecture of independent services
powered by Module Federation would mean indisputable competitive advantage. And collaboration between Zack
Jackson and Valor Software allows for joint effort in increasing MF availability for business.

==== *In conclusion*

Module Federation, a game-changer in JavaScript architecture, has boldly entered the market and been adopted by
the ecosystems of giants like SAP and Google. Despite this fact, it’s still on the way to reaching the peak of
success. We're looking forward to the breakthroughs in deployments and sharing dependencies coming from the
ambitious cooperation that made a reason for this publication!

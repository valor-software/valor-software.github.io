<p>Valor Software is not only a software development company but also a great contributor to
the Angular development community: being creators of <a href="https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ngx-bootstrap</a>, we
strive to improve our beloved library as Angular innovates. This time we worked on implementing Ivy renderer. Ivy
is a complete rewrite of the renderer with the significant refactoring of the compiler enabling devs to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reach better build times (thanks to incremental compilation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a bundle smaller and faster, which will be especially useful for mobiles (with a generated code more
compatible with tree shaking)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlock new potential features (metaprogramming or higher order components, lazy loading of the component
instead of modules, a new change detection system that is not based on zone.js, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_road_to_success_implementing_ivy">Road To Success: Implementing Ivy</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the promising features above, we&#8217;ve had two goals in mind:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Make ngx-bootstrap compatible with other projects, which are using ngx-bootstrap and ivy:enabled.&amp;nbsp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make all of our demos ivy:enabled-compatible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In total, we spent about five days to achieve our goals with Ivy support (1 developer + 1 QA engineer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, implementation was not an easy task. The first issue which we faced is that Ivy-ngcc doesn&#8217;t support
the spread operator inside @NgModule. After <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/pull/5268/files#diff-768d8aaacb20fff9a181d4fe63e131bcL61" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing it</a>, we&#8217;ve achieved our first goal and ngx-bootstrap <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/blob/development/CHANGELOG.md#510-2019-06-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began to support Ivy</a> from version 5.1.0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s better already. But we also have to update our demo app to Ivy compatible format. It was a bit
harder to achieve: we faced several issues. Let&#8217;s go through them one by one:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The host should not return a redirect source file from 'getSourceFile' (related <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/22524" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular Issue</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Angular 8, they&#8217;ve changed the TypeScript output to ES6, so instead of using <em>this.hostAdapter</em>
we now need to use <em>this.hostAdapter</em> when searching for the line number.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, the Angular team still hasn&#8217;t proceeded to resolve the issue. So we had to temporarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monkey patch</a> Angular to fix the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p>ERROR in demo/src/__ng_typecheck__.ts(857,9): error TS2551: Property 'innerHtml' does not exist on type
'HTMLParagraphElement'.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The root cause of the second issue is that <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31366" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'innerHtml' binding
got broken since Angular 8.0.0</a>, as Angular 7 had no strict check for templates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fix this, we&#8217;ve changed all occurrences of innerHtml to innerHTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li>
<p>Injecting the deprecated renderer (<a href="https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renderer</a>) is not supported, so we had
to use <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/Renderer2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renderer2</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our library and demo application (which uses this library) live in a mono repo, so for the demo
application to use the ngx-bootstrap library as if it were installed from npm packages, we had to <a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/how-to-use-npm-link-7375b6219557" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> our dist (compiled library) with the node_modules folder (named ngx-bootstrap)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, unfortunately, the dist binding to node_modules cannot be handled by Ivy, so the compiled
ngx-bootstrap must be placed directly inside the node_modules.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our case, this caused the following errors:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can&#8217;t bind to 'ngClass' since it isn&#8217;t a known property.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We dealt with those two by writing a <a href="https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap/pull/5285/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2R28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-liner</a> that copies the entire folder and renames it.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li>
<p>For some reason, 'host: style' option of decorator @Component became rewritten by the same option from the class from which we inherit. This is not described well in the official documentation. As a solution, we directly updated the host element styles using the renderer method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="6">
<li>
<p>Issues with Unit Tests</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We pay great attention to unit tests, and we mean it! We run tests for different browsers,
operating systems, and we even run them for different Angular versions. So we wanted not only to fix all of
them but also add separate stages with tests into our CI, which will check ngx-bootstrap with Ivy:enabled and
disabled, respectively. Unit tests help us to make sure that we&#8217;re delivering the qualitative library to a
massive audience of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the process of implementing Ivy, we&#8217;ve noticed that event triggering inside our tests is not working as
expected:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>const directive = fixture.debugElement.query( By.directive(PopoverDirective));directive.triggerEventHandler('click', {});</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To resolve the issue, we used the cross-browser library for testing <a href="https://github.com/NetanelBasal/spectator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@netbasal/spectator</a>.</p>

reducement.</p>

<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JAMstack</a>. It recently entered top charts
of technology choice for the web because of its ease of use, performance, and flexibility. Scully, a static site
generator, brings JAMstack to the next level of effectiveness because of its Angular nature. Valor Software
decided to adopt Scully to make the client&#8217;s platform fast and really convenient to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We
sped up the overall page load and increased the platform lighthouse score to 99-100. Also, connecting Google
eCommerce Marketing helped us see several areas for improvement on the website and in mobile apps to streamline
the user journey. Learn from our experience how you can achieve a boost in website performance and visibility
for your project using Scully and Google Analytics. Also, I&#8217;m going to help you overcome possible difficulties
with integrations since we&#8217;ve already been there :)</p>

<h4 id="_project_background"><strong>Project background</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, our team&#8217;s job on this project was to reconsider the B2C platform for
a game company. They had an outdated landing, as well as mobile apps that users didn&#8217;t really want to use. We
were on a global mission to understand the current project situation, and then - bring value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The
client had no insights in terms of the website load, performance, storage allocation, etc. And you can easily
guess what we found once we peeked under the hood (it was a pile of legacy code there). At this point, we
understood that something new, quick, and easy to manage needs to be built instead. That&#8217;s how <a href="https://scully.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scully</a> came into play.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_scully_and_how_to_deploy"><strong>What is Scully and how to deploy</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. In this kind of
architecture, JavaScript runs entirely on the client-side and handles any dynamic programming. Reusable APIs
cover all the server-side processes, and Markup is markup (a site generator or Webpack), and it needs to be
pre-built.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scully generates static sites for Angular, those with no backend code, so no
API call is needed to get the data from the server. Instead, we put all the content on our pages as data and
text and make it available to end users. This <a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/angular-static-site-generator-scully" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scully Tutorial</a> tells you all you need to know for smooth deployment.</p>

<h4 id="_now_lighthouse_score_reaches_100"><strong>Now Lighthouse score reaches 100</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a>, an
open-source tool for checking and improving the quality of web pages in this project. You can run it through
any webpage for performance, accessibility, SEO, and other audits. On completion, you get a report with
suggestions for improvements, and all that is left is bringing those to life :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Lighthouse
score represents the results from performance metrics that the tool gathered based on real website performance
data. We considered the score to evaluate the website general performance: whether and how Scully changed the
picture. And I can tell that once we switched to Scully, the platform&#8217;s Lighthouse score grew from 56 to
99-100. This indicator includes performance, accessibility, SEO, and application of best practices, as you can
see from the screen below.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we remember the basics of the Google search logic, then the crawling stage comes first, to discover
publicly available web pages and connected links, and bring this data back to the Google server. Then
indexing, when Google tries to understand what the website is about in terms of content, images, video, etc.,
to categorize the object and put it "on the right shelf" in a huge Google index storage. Finally, we have
serving and ranking, when in response to a user&#8217;s query Google goes through its index, searching for the most
appropriate and quality answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Angular applications are rendered at runtime, so it takes Google
bots longer to recognize the content since they have to execute JS code first. And Scully helps us pre-render
each route&#8217;s HTML content. It generates a static version of each website page and eases the mission for bots
to see the content. That&#8217;s exactly what helped us improve the platform indexing and visibility.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To remove CSS that we
don&#8217;t need when building for production, we used Tailwind CSS. This CSS framework in the first place lets you
easily style your website or app. And what&#8217;s more important in our case, it helped us to get rid of unused
styles and optimize builds' size.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As creators claim, when removing unused styles with Tailwind,
you never end up with more than 10kb of compressed CSS. Learn more about the framework and its worth from the

<p>Firstly, our release of an Alpha version of the platform tuned by Scully drew users to the product. By
product, I mean in-app traits for gamers like a range of different cosmetics, including skins and pets. Scully
brought us more visitors and buyers among those who already played the game and knew about the platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another part of the audience came because of better SEO optimization. Optimized content made the
platform visible and helped new users find the website. You can see the situation before and after from the

<p>The
eCommerce part of Google Analytics is what you definitely want to apply to gather insights on user behavior
and preferences. You can also understand who makes up your core audience, if that&#8217;s what you lack, and then -
build more efficient marketing campaigns. eCommerce gives you access to your audience&#8217;s gender, age,
geographical location. The only thing you should take care of to obtain needed data is <a href="https://tagmanager.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tags</a>. You&#8217;ve got to manage them right when
setting up analytics. The following links will help you tune your tags for enhanced eCommerce:</p>

<p>We integrated Google eCommerce tracking and provided our clients with the data they needed for planning
future website and mobile apps upgrades. One of the most important things that we started to track is the
checkout process - from the moment when the product falls into the basket through filling in the form for
online payment to the actual purchase. Clients could realize what may stop a user from a purchase, what stands
in the way of accomplishing the checkout. Now they have a data-driven basis for targeting bigger goals in the
future.</p>

described in this <a href="https://ppcexpo.com/blog/where-is-the-google-analytics-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPCexpo
material</a>). But when we switched to Scully and went on connecting Google Analytics to the Scully website, a
conflict between Google Tag Manager and HTTPS packages arose. <strong>So, we created a plugin to pre-build
this connection for Scully to add the piece of code for Google Analytics without any modifications:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">

    const siteTag: string = googleAnalyticsConfig['globalSiteTag']; // your gtmTagId
    const googleAnalyticsScript = `
      // your GA script code here

    return html.replace(/&lt;\/head/i, `${googleAnalyticsScript} [];

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This switch to JAMstack and Scully gave us a
tremendous amount of benefits, even those both we and the client didn&#8217;t expect to get. For example, it was a
surprise that we&#8217;ll have better Google indexing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my point of view, the main gain for this
project (just like for most of them) is transparency. With such a clear structure and interaction between
frontend and backend, you know exactly what&#8217;s happening on your Scully website. And when you know, you can
react, and actually handle complexities that arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sure, there&#8217;s still much work to do,
but we have bright perspectives. We plan to deepen tracking of eCommerce indicators, since this will give the
client more ground for new business turns. Also, we&#8217;ll be working on mobile apps to increase users' engagement
even more!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here I shared our first experience and thus impressions from the technology.

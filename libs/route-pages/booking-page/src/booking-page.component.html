				Humanity stands for the frontline of the whole organization
				activity, therefore this project is exclusive in priorities. Our client is not pursuing a goal to
				increase
				income with the app but rather solving a particular problem – the sooner their staff gets the
				working
				solution, the better they can do their job, and the more people get help. So, we put
				functionality
				and
				vitality under harsh conditions first while minimizing the maintenance effort for the product.

				In this project the design part was the first part in the play. We’ve started with it – precisely, with
				the
				improvement of the user journey. What’s more important than that, right?<br>
				Only when we actually impressed (at least it seemed like it) the customer with this core value for the
				project, development came into play. Now is the time for good advice you never asked for – Analyze and
				Fix
				Mistakes first, then do all the rest. The rest is less important!

			Valorians are proud to release the MVP version for the mobile application within a month since we
			started
			working on this project. We're honored to be fully in charge of the mobile part and, since recently,
			developing the web platform. Our team including designer, backend, frontend, and QA engineers, became
			part
			of a big international unit and blended into their existing development flow.

				Pursuing the client’s goal to get the working app in the shortest time possible within a strictly
				limited
				budget, we’ve built a cross-platform solution using React Native. The framework allows sharing of the
				logic
				layer of the app between iOS and Android, and uses JavaScript to compile the app’s user interface. This
				way,
				we saved money for the development as we had just one team involved instead of two and still kept the
				app's
				native look and feel.

                Our customers have already achieved huge success with the Breethe app for iOS-powered devices when they
                turned to Valor to build the version for Android. Our main challenge with this project was delivering
                the first version of the app within a limited time for start. Later – a complete replication of the
                design and the functional scope of the iOS app, which has been on the market for a while. Below, we’re
                sharing a story of how we handled this challenge and did a bit more than that! Which Valor also owes to
                a beautiful Coral team that is extremely open, passionate about the product, and available for any
                questions cause no questions are stupid, as we know.

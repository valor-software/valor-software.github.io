                    We started working with Louis when his team already had a functional mobile app and web version.
                    However, the current version has become outdated after a year since it was developed. Valor took on
                    the task of code exploration, bug fixing, and eventually server reconsideration. This is where the
                    real story begins :)

                    The mobile app using Cordova was created more than a year ago before we took it over. The web
                    version uses Vue.js. The main challenge was with the admin system and its controls. We also worked
                    on the web and mobile versions from time to time, and eventually released them on the App Store and
                    Google Play Android Store.

                The onboarding process is a breeze – just download the app, register, and take a quick survey (8-10
                questions) that will help us create custom content for you based on your preferences, gender, and any
                possible sexual traumas you may have experienced.

                After that, you'll get personalized lessons, practices, and tasks. These "journeys" consist of a series
                of steps, with texts, audio, and questionnaires to help you learn and grow. And the best part is, you
                can either pay for a subscription (60 bucks a year) or stick with the free version of the app. The free
                version doesn't have all the content, but it's still pretty cool.

                helpful.

                        Coral's initial goal is to educate and promote knowledge sharing, which sets us apart from the
                        competition, and makes us a unique and safe app for years to come. Our forums are filled with
                        sexologists and experts from various fields and universities, so you can get reliable advice and
                        information. Plus, you can connect with your partner in the app, which offers a different
                        experience and content.

                        And if you buy a subscription, your partner gets access for free – sharing deepens connections,
                        and that's what Coral aims to do for you! :)

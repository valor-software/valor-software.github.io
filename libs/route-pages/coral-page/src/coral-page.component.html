                    We started working with Lewis when his team already had a functional mobile app and web version.
                    However, the current version went outdated a year after it saw the world. Valor took on the task of
                    bug fixing. Eventually, we were up to server reconsideration when the real story begins :)

                    What we had there was a Cordova-based app built more than a year before we took it over and the web
                    version using Vue.js. The main challenge we faced was with the admin system and its controls. We
                    also worked on the web and mobile versions from time to time before releasing them on the App Store
                    and Google Play Android Store.

                possible sexual traumas you may have experienced.

                After that, you'll get personalized lessons, practices, and tasks. These "journeys" consist of a series
                of steps, with texts, audio, and questionnaires to help you learn and grow. And the best part is, you
                can either pay for a subscription (60 bucks a year) or stick with the free version of the app. The free
                version doesn't have all the content, but it's still pretty cool.

                        Coral's initial goal is to educate and promote knowledge sharing, which sets us apart from the
                        competition, and makes us a unique and safe app for years to come. Our forums are filled with
                        sexologists and experts from various fields and universities, so you can get reliable advice and
                        information. Plus, you can connect with your partner in the app, which offers a different
                        experience and content.

                        And if you buy a subscription, your partner gets access for free – sharing deepens connections,
                        and that's what Coral aims to do for you! :)

                    We all live with different fears and some of them are completely irrational, like the fear of
                    subways or pigeons. But there’s a fear that is not just unhelpful but narrows the way people
                    perceive the world and interact with others. Unfortunately, xenophobia or fear of foreigners and
                    strangers still exists, and Anna Rosling, a co-founder of Gapminder and one of Bill Gates'

                    30,000 photos
                    to show the lives of ordinary families from many different angles. You can see everything from

                        Initially, we worked on moving the pictures and the descriptions of each family
                        participating in
                        the
                        project to the database and then – to the AWS cloud. The next step was to create the admin
                        panel
                        for
                        Dollar Street with the three main branches: things, places, and data management.

                        Alongside the work on the admin panel, we cooperated with the client on the website design
                        creation.
                        They already had some workarounds, and the Valor’s designer contributed to the designs’
                        finalization
                        and implementation.

                        Once the platform was released, Dollar Street got a crazy amount of attention, including the

                        to
                        the app. It was pretty unexpected, and the website
                        got overwhelmed with the load, so we had to do smth with its ability to overcome stress tests
                        when the traffic is high.

                        million! To quickly stabilize the site, Valor’s engineers made a replica of 3 instances on
                        clusters in MongoDB Cloud. For a long-term solution, we set up Kubernetes on Google Cloud
                        Services, dockerized the app, set up auto-scaling, and added Cloudflare for cache, since the
                        site is static.

                        We used AngularJS for building the first version of Dollar Street. Later we moved it to Angular
                        2, then – to Angular 7, and until now, we’ve continued updating the Angular versions to the
                        newest (currently, Angular 13).

                    We’ve added a range of features that made Dollar Street more interactive and exciting to
                    explore.
                    For instance, a video feature contributes to a better view of the families’ households and helps
                    get
                    a bigger picture of the way people live their day-to-day life on the other side of the globe.
                    Also,
                    we’ve developed a blog and added comparison, so you can filter the feed based on keywords,

			<p><strong class="text-pink">Atlanta, Georgia - May 12th, 10am Eastern</strong>
				Today,
				<a href="https://valor-software.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valor Software</a>
				together with
				<a href="https://nx.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nx</a>
				and
				<a href="https://rosa.be/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosa</a>
				are announcing Rspack support for NestJS.

				<p>"Hospitals and healthcare professionals trust Rosa to manage their schedule and appointments.
				   Patients rely on Rosa to book their medical appointments. As a mission critical company in the business of
				   saving lives,
				   we know that even a single moment of downtime can be devastating.
				   Every second matters! A production downtime incident that is waiting for builds that take 15+ minutes is
				   simply unacceptable when people's lives are at stake.
				   As such we are constantly looking for ways to improve our build process
				</p>

				<p>Cherry on the cake: it also improves the DX.</p>

				<p>When we saw the Rspack
					<a href="https://valor-software.com/press-release/rs-pack-rust-based-web-bundler"
					   target="_blank"
					   rel="noopener">announcement
					</a>
				   by Valor in March we knew we wanted to see if Rspack could improve our
				   builds. We engaged with them to fund this project.”

			<p>Rosa selected Valor Software to add NestJS support to Rspack via Nx and integrate it into their existing
			   applications.
			   After working in collaboration with the Nx team, Valor is excited to share that initial support and performance
			   results are now available for release and testing by the wider community.

				<p>"Building on our partnership with Valor Software and our existing integrations
				   for Rspack added by our team last Month, it was a pleasure for us to collaborate on extending our support for
				   NestJS.</p>

				<p>
					This project allowed us the opportunity to not only enhance our existing support for NestJS, but also to
					improve our existing integrations with Rspack.
				</p>

				<p>The performance is simply amazing and the ecosystem is wonderful to work with”</p>

			<p>With over 56k stars on
				<a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and over 2.2 million
			   downloads a week on
				<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPM</a>, NestJS is an
			   incredibly popular
			   if not the default Node.js framework for developers in 2023. NestJS under the covers was leveraging webpack
			   to conduct its builds and additionally supports a custom build configuration.
			   This mechanism was used to add Rspack support for NestJS.</p>

			<quote author="Kamil Mysliwiec"
			       authorTitle="Co-Founder Trilon and Creator of NestJS">
				<p>“When I created NestJS in 2017 I was working on it as a side project, during that time I wanted to create
				   something that was scalable, efficient, and fully supported TypeScript. Since its creation NestJS has grown
				   to be one of the most popular Node.js frameworks that I know of. </p>

				<p>When our partners at Valor reached out to us and mentioned they were going to work on adding Rspack support
				   we were happy to see what progress they would make. After seeing the initial performance improvements we are
				   thrilled to welcome Rspack to the possible ways to build NestJS”

			<quote author="Antoine Pairet"
			       authorTitle="Founder and CTO at Rosa">
				<p>
					“Migrating NestJS to Rspack is a part of an overall build process improvement project for Rosa. 
					Thanks to Valor, we were was able to take our build times from roughly 30 minutes to 7 minutes in less than a month. 
					After we pull through the remaining changes that are in progress we expect to be under 3 minutes for our full build on our CI pipeline. 
					We are looking forward to share more details once we wrap it up.”

			<p>There was a minor change to switch to the rspack “withNx” plugin in our webpack (now Rspack) config to
			   ‘@nrwl/rspack’ and setting the project.json to use the executor ‘@nrwl/rspack:rspack’ and point to a
			   ‘rspackConfig’ instead of a ‘webpackConfig’ </p>

			<quote author="Zack Jackson"
			       authorTitle="Principal Architect at Lululemon and creator of Webpack Module Federation">
				<p>“After reviewing the configurations for the applications, there are improvements that could have been made
				   within webpack itself to achieve a portion of the gains seen here with Rspack. However it requires combining
				   in depth knowledge of webpack and an increase to the configuration that would then need to be maintained.
				   With Rspack all of the optimizations and improvements came for “free” and just simply works. It is configured
				   to be performant by default and there is a very small margin for error.”

			<p>Install the Nx
				<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nx/rspack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plugin</a>
			   today and try Rspack, Nx, and NestJS! We have a
				<a href="https://github.com/valor-labs/nest-rspack-nx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple example</a>
			   demonstrating how to use this powerful
			   combination of technologies on GitHub.
			</p>

			<h2 class="!text-2xl !mt-9 !mb-5">Pending issues requiring further effort</h2>

			<p>
				While the project itself and this release is considered a success there is still some work to be done to improve
				it. We would love any help with pull requests!

                TablesReady is a waitlist service that allows users to
                easily manage waitlists, order backlogs, and other waiting scenarios relevant to their industry. Using
                guests' cell phones instead of expensive pager systems, TR helps business owners save time and money.

                    At the moment we started our collaboration more than 7 years ago, the client had an idea, a product
                    vision, basic designs, and the architecture plus code that needed optimization and integration of
                    new concepts. The first Valor-built app version utilized PHP and AngularJS, but as time went by, we
                    implemented several crucial modernizations. Also, we've reached a great deal of success with
                    analytics that help track average wait times, busy hours, and walk-ins.

                        We migrated the code of the application from PHP to Node.js, and from AngularJS to Angular
                        correspondingly, which brought greater flexibility and many more benefits listed below.
                        Another
                        part
                        of this big transformation was switching from the MongoDB database to PostgreSQL, which was
                        a
                        bit
                        challenging but worth every effort.

                        <b>Challenge:</b> As we had to move the application from a
                        non-relational database to relational, accurate work with data was a must. We had to make
                        sure
                        nothing got lost because of the transition, and this consumed time and required domain
                        expertise.

                        <b>Solution:</b> Even though the major part of the transition was automated, we also applied
                        manual
                        schema mapping to ensure accurate data migration.

                Our client wanted to give more freedom and flexibility to the TablesReady audience in terms of managing
                subscriptions and getting the most out of the platform for every particular business. Initially, users
                had two plans to choose from: a paid subscription and an enterprise plan, both with a free trial period.
                Valor’s team has added new functionality to the admin panel that allows users to subscribe to a free
                plan or pick the most suitable among several Premium plans depending on their guests’ turnover. Also,
                users now can set up the subscription types and switch between plans on their own!

                We reworked the user interface to make the app more user-friendly, and up-to-date. Our goal was to make
                the user flow throughout the system more smoothly. Also, we add a dark mode feature to give an option to
                users to choose which mode they are comfortable using.

                Among numerous plans for the future, the reorganization of the accounts structure is possibly the
                biggest and the most substantial one. Currently, there is a one-to-one relationship between accounts and
                locations, but we will make that a 1-to-many relationship. This will bring business accounts the
                opportunity to have multiple points of sales, with each having its own subscription model. Looking
                forward to this new feature, and to describing it in the next reviews!
